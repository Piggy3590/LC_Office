# Before reporting a bug
- Dungeon generation desynchronization (dungeons are created on different hosts and clients) is an LLL issue.
- Make sure you have the latest version of the mod, and if not, check the Changelog to see if the bug has been fixed! *(Although you don't have to)*
- Other desync issues (elevator, creatures, etc.) are issues with my mod! If you find it, please report it!
